# physics-engine
Starting as a 3D render, working towards making a basic physics engine

#To Do:
* Add UI
* Improve lighting
* implement backface culling
* add ability to click objects and manipulate them
* add axis to help see which way camera is looking
* improve rendering efficiency in general (currently has trouble at 5k+ faces)

# physics-engine
Starting as a 3D render, working towards making a basic physics engine. \
Currently only works for convex objects

# To Do:
* Add UI
* Improve lighting
* add ability to click objects and manipulate them
* add axis to help see which way camera is looking
* improve rendering efficiency in general (currently has trouble at 5k+ faces)
* add way to create center of mass based off volume (assuming uniform density)
* Implement Generics(?)

# Fix:s
* rotations break after switching between camera and object mode
* collisions dont work
